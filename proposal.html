      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p>
        1. Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing
        the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?
      </p>
      <p>
        The users of this app can be young children, new English learners, or
        busy parents that might not be comfortable teaching their young
        children. The app will have a net benefit to groups of people that might
        not have the funds or the ability to have tutoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. What kind of information will the users be viewing? If intend to use
        data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and
        citation to that data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way that the users are accessing the information in this matter I
        think an API would be able to work well, being able to have access to
        the words synonyms, antonyms, and etc will be very helpful to the
        learning aspect.
