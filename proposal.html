    <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
    <p>In the realm of parenting, a pressing challenge often faced by new parents is the availability of high-quality
      and accessible educational resources for their young children. This issue relates to the broader domain of early
      childhood education, where vocabulary development plays a pivotal role. Research demonstrates the critical
      connection between a child's vocabulary growth and their overall school achievement [1]. Moreover, a child's
      vocabulary size in kindergarten serves as a strong predictor of their ability to learn to read [2], highlighting
      the profound impact of early language skills on educational success.

      The more words a child knows, the more information they can access, fostering critical thinking and a deeper
      understanding of the world around them. Encouraging children's vocabulary development is essential to ensure they
      acquire the language and literacy skills necessary to thrive in school and beyond. However, despite the importance
      of this issue, there is an information technology problem that needs attention and
      innovation. Existing websites and apps attempt to address the vocabulary development challenge but often fall
      short in terms of content quality, accessibility, or user experience.

      To bridge this gap effectively, a comprehensive web application is needed to cater to the vocabulary development
      needs of both parents and young learners. Our proposed word teaching website aims to address this problem by
      providing a valuable tool for parents to facilitate the education of their young children. Through our platform,
      parents can access a wealth of educational materials and interesting activities designed to support their child's
      early learning journey, making the process of nurturing and educating young minds more manageable and enjoyable.

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    <p class="question">
      1. Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing
      the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      The users of this app can be young children, new English learners, or
      busy parents that might not be comfortable teaching their young
      children. The app will have a net benefit to groups of people that might
      not have the funds or the ability to have tutoring.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      2. What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide?
      Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly
      identify and explain what all of them are! Remember: Our main users would be young children, new English learners.
      And parents are our secondary audience. Users will use this web app to learn the English words.
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      Our main users would be young children, new English learners. And parents are our secondary audience. Users will
      use this web app to learn the English words. Three main interactive features we are expecting to provide are
      uploading, words quiz, and word games. We provide words imported from external. Parents can also upload words that
      they want their children to learn. Aftering learning new words, our main users can play the word game for fun, or
      improving their understanding. Then, main users would take a quiz on what they have learned. One small feature is
      the search/filter. Users can find words by searching or filting them in different categories.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      3. What kind of information will the users be viewing? If intend to use
      data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and
      citation to that data.
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      The way that the users are accessing the information in this matter I
      think an API would be able to work well, being able to have access to
      the words synonyms, antonyms, and etc will be very helpful to the
      learning aspect.

    </p>
    <p class="question">
      4. How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you
      described? Remember: the app doesn't need to have "business value". But as Informatics students we care about the
      practical usage and impacts of systems, not just their implementation. Be sure to consider that in your proposal!
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      This web is expected to provide accessible and quality education resources. The web is all free to everyone. It
      provides convenience to parents and gives the parents guidance. Parents are able to track children learning
      progress. For our main users, children, this web provides wide range of words education content. Our interactive
      feature, playing words games will make the learning process more enjoyable and fun. The positive feedbacks and
      rewards will motivate them to keep a positive attitude toward learning.
