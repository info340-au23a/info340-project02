      <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
      <p>
        In the realm of modern day parenting, new parents often face a pressing challenge: the availability of high-quality and accessible educational resources for their young children. This issue relates to the broader domain of early childhood education, where vocabulary development plays a pivotal role. Research demonstrates the critical connection between a child's vocabulary growth and overall school achievement <a href="https://www.hanen.org/Programs/For-Educators/ABC-and-Beyond.aspx">[1]</a>. Moreover, a child's vocabulary size in kindergarten serves as a strong predictor of their ability to learn to read <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01805.x">[2]</a>, highlighting the profound impact of early language skills on educational success.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more words a child knows, the more information they can access at a young age, fostering critical thinking and a deeper understanding of the world around them. Encouraging children's vocabulary development ensures they acquire the language and literacy skills necessary to thrive in school and beyond. However, despite this issue's importance, an information technology problem needs attention and innovation. Existing websites and apps attempt to address the vocabulary development challenge but often fall short in terms of content quality, accessibility, or user experience.
      </p>
      <p>To bridge this gap effectively, a comprehensive web application is needed to cater to parents and young learners' vocabulary development needs. Spelling Adventures aims to address this problem by providing a valuable tool for parents to facilitate the education of their young children. Through our platform, parents can access a wealth of educational materials and exciting activities to support their child's early learning journey, making nurturing and educating young minds more manageable and enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, for individuals with developmental challenges, early and consistent exposure to vocabulary can offer essential tools to communicate better, comprehend, and engage with their surroundings. Yet, current technological solutions often under-serve these individuals. Our web application aims to address this disparity as well.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p class="question">
        1. Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Our primary audience would be young children, new English learners, and individuals with developmental disabilities. Our secondary audience would be parents, guardians, and educators who are seeking an effective and engaging tool to supplement traditional learning methods. The app will benefit groups who may lack resources or access to tutoring. The ability to switch word sets will allow for individuals with learning disabilities to have a consistent, accessible way to learn new vocabulary at their own pace.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        2. What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are! Remember: Users will use this web app to learn the English words.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
         We expect to provide three main interactive features: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flashcards: Introduce and study words, audio pronunciations, definitions, usage, and language tips.</li>
        <li>Crossword Puzzles:  Successfully completing the crossword earns the user a star The quiz format would be filling the letter in the blanks with a provided picture as the cue. Accumulating ten stars enables users to progress to more advanced crosswords. Word sets can be divided into various categories such as animals, fruits, and more. These puzzles serve as engaging challenges that will help the user think critically about the word and it's definition. If a user is stuck, they can press a help button and a picture cue will assist them. Users can search through pre-defined word categories and select their preferred crossword puzzle categories for an enjoyable and improved educational experience. To encourage learning a broad vocabulary, a previously completed crossword category will not grant the user another star.</li>
        <li>User Login: Allows tracking of individual progress and word set preferences.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p class="question">
        3. What kind of information will the users be viewing? If intend to use data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        The way that the users are accessing the information in this matter, an authentic API <a
          href="https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-elementary-dictionary"> [3]</a> would be able to work well; having access to the words synonyms, antonyms, etc, will be beneficial to the learning aspect. The API referenced is Merriam-Webster's Elementary Dictionary API, which includes vocabulary for grades 3-5, as well as definitions, examples, language tips, pronunciation, and more. Parents, guardians or educators also have the ability to choose between word sets for grades 3-5, 6-8, and 9-11, which can be implemented using Merriam-Webster's Dictionary APIs <a href="https://dictionaryapi.com/products/index">[4]</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        4. How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described? Remember: the app doesn't need to have "business value". But as Informatics students we care about the practical usage and impacts of systems, not just their implementation. Be sure to consider that in your proposal!
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        The primary objective of our web app is to offer accessible English learning educational resources at no cost. Designed with an intuitive, user-centric approach, it not only eases the challenges parents face in guiding their child's educational journey but also enriches the learning experience with a diverse range of words and content. The core audience, children and individuals with learning disabilities, can benefit immensely from interactive features like flashcards and crossword puzzles, making learning fun and engaging. Furthermore, the app's built-in reward system will foster a proactive and positive learning attitude, serving as both motivation and reinforcement.</p>
